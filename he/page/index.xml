      <description>As a Full Stack Developer, I am committed to inspiring and supporting underrepresented groups in the tech industry, particularly women and other backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented. I believe a diverse and inclusive tech community leads to better solutions. As a mother of three, I understand the unique challenges that come with balancing a career in tech and family life. I want to serve as a role model and mentor for other women and mothers in the industry, and to help create a more inclusive environment for them.</description>
